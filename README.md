# Habitect
An interactive, AI-powered design tool that helps astronauts, engineers, and space enthusiasts create and visualize personalized space habitats — whether on the ISS, the Moon, or Mars.




🎯 Inspiration
Living in space requires balancing comfort, safety, and efficiency. Astronauts spend months in confined habitats, so layout optimization (sleeping, working, exercising, eating) is critical. A tool that combines engineering constraints with human-centered design could help future crews plan better living environments.
🛠️ What It Does
Interactive Layout Builder: Drag-and-drop modules (sleep pods, workstations, labs, greenhouses, gyms) into a 2D/3D habitat canvas.
AI Optimization: Suggests best placement for airlocks, solar panels, exercise areas, and life-support systems.
Human Factors Simulation: Checks for privacy, lighting, noise, and workflow comfort.
Multi-Environment Templates: ISS module, lunar base, Martian dome.
Export & Share: Generate schematics or VR-compatible layouts.
🔧 How We Build It
Frontend:
Web app using React + Three.js (for 3D interactive layouts).
Mobile-friendly for quick edits.
Backend:
Python (FastAPI/Flask) for simulation and AI checks.
Constraint-solving AI (e.g., OR-Tools) for space optimization.
AI Models:
GPT-based module for habitat design suggestions (“Where should I place a hydroponic garden?”).
CV/physics engine for radiation exposure checks and line-of-sight lighting.
Data Sources:
NASA’s open ISS schematics, Mars habitat studies, Artemis plans.
Collaboration:
Users can co-design habitats in real time (Google Docs style).
🚀 Challenges We Anticipate
Modeling realistic space constraints (radiation shielding, life support, mass/volume limits).
Balancing fun, creative design for the public with engineering realism for professionals.
Handling 3D rendering efficiently in browsers for thousands of users.
🏆 Accomplishments (Vision)
A tool that lets students, makers, and scientists co-create living spaces for space missions.
Helps NASA visualize public input on habitat designs.
Bridges engineering and creativity in one platform.
📚 What We’ll Learn
How to integrate human-centered design principles with hard space constraints.
How to make collaborative space design fun and educational.
How to extend open NASA data into usable, interactive apps.
🔮 What’s Next
Add VR/AR integration so users can “walk inside” their space homes.
Connect with 3D printing workflows for physical prototypes.
Use it in classrooms worldwide for STEM engagement.
Expand to Martian city layouts, not just habitats.
